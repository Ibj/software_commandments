This project currently includes 

- a copy of the original commandments from 1996 in MS-Word format
- version 2.0 in both PDF and Libre Office formats.

For both these versions a design goal was to keep the document to a single side of paper. 
Arguably there's too much information - so I am considering adopting a different format. 

Any contributions in the following areas will be gratefully considered
- improve/clarify the text 
- additional commandments
- promotion of the commandments throughout the software community
- complementary materials and/or alternative delivery versions (eg presentations, videos etc)
